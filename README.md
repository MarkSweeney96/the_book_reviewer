# The Book Reviewer

The Book Reviewer is a book review site I designed and developed in my second year of college. This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP and a MySQL database. It is a book review site with a large focus on overall design, layout and typography. The home page shows the ‘review of the week’, bestsellers, latest and more. Users can then view individual book reviews in an article format. The admin tools then allow an easy way for administrators to create, edit, update and delete book reviews.

## Installation
To install this project on your computer, you will need to:
1. Install a local Apache Web Server and a MySQL database server. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a good piece of software that installs both.   
2. Create a new database called 'book_reviewer' and import the __book_reviewer.sql__ file located in this repository.
3. __NB__: Make sure the __classes/Connection.php__ file has the correct information for your local web server and database.
